# Network Security Awareness and Tools

## Overview
This repository aims to provide an understanding of essential cybersecurity concepts and tools, including:

1. **Basic Network Sniffer**: A tool to monitor and capture network traffic.
2. **Phishing Attack Awareness**: Insights to identify and prevent phishing attacks.
3. **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**: A system to detect and respond to unauthorized network access.

## Basic Network Sniffer
A network sniffer is a tool used to monitor and capture data packets flowing through a network. It can:

- Analyze network traffic for troubleshooting.
- Detect unauthorized access or data leakage.
- Record packet data for further analysis.

### Features:
- Capture packets in real-time.
- Filter traffic by protocol (HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc.).
- Save logs for offline analysis.

### Example Tools:
- Wireshark
- tcpdump

## Phishing Attack Awareness
Phishing attacks attempt to steal sensitive information by impersonating trusted entities. They often exploit:

- Emails with malicious links or attachments.
- Fake websites mimicking legitimate ones.
- Social engineering tactics to trick users.

### Prevention Tips:
1. Verify email senders before clicking on links.
2. Avoid sharing personal information online without confirmation.
3. Use multi-factor authentication for sensitive accounts.
4. Keep software and antivirus programs updated.

### Recommended Tools:
- Anti-phishing browser extensions.
- Email filters and spam detectors.

## Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
NIDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and generates alerts for potential security breaches. It can:

- Detect abnormal patterns (e.g., port scanning, DoS attacks).
- Log malicious activity for further investigation.
- Provide real-time alerts to system administrators.

### Example Tools:
- Snort
- Suricata
- Zeek (formerly Bro)
